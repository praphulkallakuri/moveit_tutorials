Hand-Eye Calibration
====================
.. .. image: TODO, make a pretty picture

MoveIt plugins can conduct a hand-eye calibration. Here's how.

Getting Started
---------------
Unlike many of the other MoveIt tutorials, to actually complete this tutorial, you will need a robotic arm and a camera.

If you haven't already done so, make sure you've completed the steps in `Getting Started <../getting_started/getting_started.html>`_. Also, set your arm up to work with MoveIt (as described in the `Setup Assistant Tutorial <../setup_assistant/setup_assistant.html>`_).

This tutorial also requires a camera.

.. TODO: something about getting a camera running--maybe uvc_ros or whatever?
